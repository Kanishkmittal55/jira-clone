a) ETA you can trust (PERT + Monte Carlo)

For each ticket, store (O, M, P) = optimistic / most likely / pessimistic hours.
Compute ETA with PERT:
eta = (O + 4M + P) / 6, variance σ² = ((P − O)/6)².
Then simulate the whole plan (1k runs) to get:

P50/P90 completion time for the plan,

critical path (tickets that most often delay finish).

b) Probability of goal achievement

C) Risk Score per ticket

D) Early warnings 

E) The black sheep tickets for example - this is tricky as this will depend on the skill level and general I/Q or motivation that a person has to complete a project, the ETA is a very important factor I think that this is also very dependant on the skill of a person and how much they know about the goal they are trying to achieve.

Our goal is to extract this information from the user and make it so that even people with no I/Q or skill or knowledge about the goal can achieve the goal if they just follow the plan, as it plan alone doesnot have any value, execution is king, but our AI will give you the proper plan to achieve a desired goal with no extra context or some cases with context.

F) Current I/Q assessment metrics of the dev

G) Skill level assessment
