Ah yes! Looking at the queries, you already have the Project model with proper relations. Here's what needs to be changed to support multiple projects:
UI Changes:
- components/top-navbar.tsx: Add project selector dropdown next to "Jira Clone" logo
- Create new component components/project/project-selector.tsx for project switching

State Management:
- Create context/use-selected-project.tsx for project context
- Store selected projectId in localStorage/URL params
- Update useProject hook in hooks/query-hooks/use-project.ts

Route Updates:
- Update next.config.mjs redirects to include projectId: /project/[projectId]/backlog
- Move files from app/project/* to app/project/[projectId]/*
- Update middleware.ts to handle new project routes

API Adjustments:
- Update app/api/issues/route.ts to filter by projectId
- Update app/api/sprints/route.ts to filter by projectId
- Add project creation API at app/api/projects/route.ts
The core DB structure exists - we just need to expose project selection in the UI and filter data by the selected project. Would you like me to detail any specific part of these changes?
