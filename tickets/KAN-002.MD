## Title
Google sign-in doesn’t create session; can’t create Epic

## Description
Creating an Epic triggers the auth modal, but “Continue with Google” completes without establishing a session. Root causes:

- Deprecated middleware withClerkMiddleware in middleware.ts [middleware.ts:1–7].

- Deprecated provider @clerk/nextjs/app-beta in app/layout.tsx [app/layout.tsx:1].

- Mixing packages: <SignIn /> from @clerk/clerk-react instead of @clerk/nextjs in components/modals/auth.tsx [components/modals/auth.tsx:8, 29–52].

- Ensure real Clerk keys are present.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Replace middleware with authMiddleware from @clerk/nextjs/server, including config.matcher (single default export).

- Replace ClerkProvider import to @clerk/nextjs in app/layout.tsx; app boots cleanly.

- Replace SignIn to @clerk/nextjs; modal sign-in sets a session (verified via getAuth() or auth() on a protected API route).

- With valid NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY and CLERK_SECRET_KEY, clicking “Continue with Google” lets the user immediately create an Epic without another prompt.
